## Category Tasks App

Added a normalized store and ability to create categories and tasks dynamically. Creating a task just autogenerates one. Category allows you to create named one though. App should be resonsive design. Didn't get around to mimicking server requests, would've probably used ReactQuery to handle those states easily though and then have dedicated dummy "Loading" components. For example a <TaskItemLoading/ >.
